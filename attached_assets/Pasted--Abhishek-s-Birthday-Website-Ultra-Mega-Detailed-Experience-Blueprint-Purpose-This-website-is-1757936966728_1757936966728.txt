💜 Abhishek’s Birthday Website – Ultra Mega Detailed Experience Blueprint
✨ Purpose

This website is a beautiful, interactive, playful digital gift for Abhishek on his birthday. It should feel personal, soft, loving, and filled with sweet surprises. Every animation, interaction, and visual cue should feel like a little whisper of love from me to him. Nothing should be loud or overwhelming—just gentle, dreamy, and emotionally warm.

📦 Initial Setup

The entire site is built in two modes:

Development Mode – Everything visible to me when I preview.

Live Mode – Only the countdown visible to him until his birthday at midnight.

Colors are shades of purple, lavender, violet, and soft pinks mixed in gradients.

All icons are AI-generated, soft, pastel, and minimal—not emojis. Shapes like hearts, stars, moons, balloons, clouds, flowers.

Rounded corners everywhere—buttons, boxes, images, cards—to create softness.

Fonts are a mix of playful handwritten styles and rounded modern fonts to feel cozy.

📖 Flow Summary

He opens the site → countdown screen appears with floating cute icons.

He clicks icons → soft popups with teasing messages appear.

At midnight → confetti, bouquet, balloons animation unlocks the site.

Main content appears → calendar memories, gallery, flirty cards, emoji game, and notes.

Every section has interactive animations and soft sounds to make him smile.
